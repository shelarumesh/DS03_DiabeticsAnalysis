# DS03_DiabeticsAnalysis

# Data Collection: 
Gathered a dataset containing relevant features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, age, and family history of diabetes.

# Preprocessing: 
Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.

# Feature Selection: 
Identified the most significant features using techniques like correlation analysis or feature importance scores.

# Model Selection: 
Chose Logistic Regression for its simplicity, interpretability, and ability to handle binary classification tasks effectively.

# Model Training: 
Split the dataset into training and testing sets, then trained the Logistic Regression model on the training data.

# Evaluation Metrics: 
Utilized metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of the model on the test set.

# ROC Curve: 
Plotted the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and calculated the Area Under the Curve (AUC) to assess the model's discrimination ability across different thresholds.
